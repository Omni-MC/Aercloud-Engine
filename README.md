# Aercloud Engine
This is a tool for modpack developers to integrate tech mods into the aether mods much like Voltz Engine does for other mods. 


More tech based things will be added as required.
This mod is intended to be used with CraftTweaker or MineTweaker and has no use by itself.

 

## Items

Gears (Skyroot, Holystone, Zanite, Gravitite, Arkenium and Valkyrium gears)

Dusts (Gravitite, Arkenium and Valkyrium dusts)

Nuggets/Shards (Zanite shards, Ambrosium shards, Gravitite, Arkenium and Valkyrium nuggets)

Items in first release.

 Each item has some small lore entry totally unrelated to Oscar Payn's lore entries.

I am a heavy follower of Aether lore so there will only be items that fit for certain materials. (i.e. zanite screws would be part skyroot, no zanite plates(maybe an alternative), no zanite or valkyrium wires )

## To Do


### High Priority

-Make Arkenium wire compatible with forge power, RF, EU, Mj, and ÂµI.

-Add a basic generator

-Valkyrie Metal ore

-Valkyrium Alloy (Arkenium + Valkyrie Metal)


### Medium Priority

-Ex Nihilo ore chunks and pieces.

-Screws

-Plates


### Low Priority

-Circuit boards

-Anything else that I find.
